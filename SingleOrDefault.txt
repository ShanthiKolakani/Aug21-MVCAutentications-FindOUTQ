The SingleOrDefault() method does the same thing as Single() method. The only difference is that it returns default value of the data type of a collection if a collection is empty, includes more than one element or finds no element or more than one element for the specified condition.


Single :  Returns the only element from a collection, or the only element that satisfies a condition. If Single() found no elements or more than one elements in the collection then throws InvalidOperationException.


SingleOrDefault:  The same as Single, except that it returns a default value of a specified generic type, instead of throwing an exception if no element found for the specified condition. However, it will thrown InvalidOperationException if it found more than one element for the specified condition in the collection.
